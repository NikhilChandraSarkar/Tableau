# Tableau
A comprehensive resource for learning Tableau is going to build for data analytics and visualization.

## Background
This repository is a live document, continously evloving and can be considered one of the best resources to get started with Tableau.

### Chapter 1 Fundamental of Tableau
This chapter introduces the fundamental of Tableau. I'll go through the basics of connecting different data sources with Tableau. This repository will be developed far more extensively in subsequent chapters to make it a standalone resource for Tableau learners. To know about Tableau **products** and **licences**, *see this link* https://www.tableau.com/products.

Data is usually storesd in different files and databases such as following examples:
 - Flat files: Excel
 - Spatial files: shape file
 - Text files
 - Relational databases: Microsoft SQL, Oracle etc.
 - Cloud-based: Amazon Redshifts

Tableau has core functionality to connect a wide variety of data sources including flat files, spatial files, text files, relational databases, and cloud-based data.
### Chapter 2 Knowledge Based Errors Debugging
This chapter explores the process of identifying and removing errors from the Teableau. For instance, when you try to add a trend line in your visualisation, the following error might occur:

"*A trnd line cannot be computed. Typically, each axis should be either a number or a date. Refer to the Help for more information*"
- **Environment:**
Tableau Desktop

Right-click the date field on Rows or Columns, and select continuous.
